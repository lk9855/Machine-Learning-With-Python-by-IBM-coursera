Question 1
Supervised learning deals with unlabeled data, while unsupervised learning deals with labelled data.
Ans : False
Supervised Learning deals with labelled data and unsupervised learning deals with unlabelled data.

.Question 2
Which of the following is not true about Machine Learning?


Machine Learning was inspired by the learning process of human beings.


Machine Learning models iteratively learn from data, and allow computers to find hidden insights.


Machine Learning models help us in tasks such as object recognition, summarization, and recommendation.


Machine learning gives computers the ability to make decision by writing down rules and methods and being explicitly programmed.

Ans : Machine learning gives computers the ability to make decision by writing down rules and methods and being explicitly programmed. is False


3.Question 3
Which of the following groups are not Machine Learning techniques?


Classification and Clustering


Numpy, Scipy and Scikit-Learn


Anomaly Detection and Recommendation Systems

Ans: Numpy, Scipy and Scikit-Learn


4.Question 4
The "Regression" technique in Machine Learning is a group of algorithms that are used for:


Predicting a continuous value; for example predicting the price of a house based on its characteristics.


Prediction of class/category of a case; for example a cell is benign or malignant, or a customer will churn or not.


Finding items/events that often co-occur; for example grocery items that are usually bought together by a customer.

Ans : Predicting a continuous value; for example predicting the price of a house based on its characteristics.


5.Question 5
When comparing Supervised with Unsupervised learning, is this sentence True or False?

In contrast to Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning has more models and more evaluation methods that can be used in order to ensure the outcome of the model is accurate.


False


True

Ans : False
